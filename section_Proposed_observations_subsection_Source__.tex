\section{Proposed observations}
\subsection{Source selection}
  In Planck early cold core catalog with Tdust<12K),\\
  Observed by Wu et al. in 12CO, 13CO, C18O (bright 12CO, bright C18O, low Tex)\\
  Starless\\
  Close together in the sky to minimize slewing and use common pointings
\subsection{Molecular tracer selection}
  We have used the Nautilus chemical code (Wakelam et al. 2010) with typical conditions of dense cores to compute the abundances of molecules, using the WEEDS (Maret et al. 2010) LTE code we have created a synthetic spectrum of lines from molecules that are expected to be detected with at least one line at 3$\sigma$ level in the bandwidth proposed (full 36GHz of the 3mm band and first 36GHz of the 2mm band). The 2mm band is required for the detection of deuterated species. 39 molecules will be detected, including 12 isotopologues containing deuterium, $^{13}C$ and $^{18}O$ and $^{15}N$. Table~\ref{tab:detections} summarizes the detectable molecules and Fig~\ref{fig:setup} shows the synthetic spectra.
