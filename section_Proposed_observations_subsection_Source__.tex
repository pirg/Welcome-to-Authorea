\section{Proposed observations}
\subsection{Source selection}
  Planck cold cores (Planck early cold core catalog), bright in CO + cold in Tex (Wu et al.) + starless (c2d??, Herschel ?)
\subsection{Molecular tracer selection}
  We have used the Nautilus chemical code (Wakelam et al. 2010) with typical contitions of dense cores to compute the abundances of molecules, using the WEEDS (Maret et al. 2010) LTE code we have created a synthetic spectrum of lines from molecules that are expected to be detected with at least one line at 3$\sigma$ level in the bandwidth proposed (full 36GHz of the 3mm band and first 36GHz of the 2mm band). The 2mm band is required for the detection of deuterated species. XXX molecules will be detected (with XXX more possible). Along with XXX isotopologues containing deuterium, $^{13}C$ and $^{18}O$ and $^{15}N$. Table~\ref{tab.detections} summarizes the detectable molecules. And Fig~\ref{fig:setup} shows the synthetic spectra.
