\section{Technical justification}
With 1h integration time per frequency channel of 50kHz, a uniform sensitivity survey can be achieved with a median rms od 30mK over the full 3mm band and 35mK over the lower 36GHz of the 2mm band. 

A 36Ghz bandwidth can be covered uniformely,in dual polarization, with 10 tunings using the FTS in its 50kHz narrow mode and one of the sideband. Nevertheless because of the limited band rejection (particularly at 2mm) care must be ensures to observe each sky frequency with at least 2 different LO tunings. This is why we propose to use 18 tunings shifted by half an FTS unit bandwidth each observed for 30 minutes integration time.
