\section{Scientific objectives}

 Several groups have proposed new mechanisms to explain the observed abundances of complex organic molecules. \cite{Vasyunin_2013} for instance proposed a two step scenario: first evaporation the formation of precursor radical on the surfaces 



\begin{itemize}
\item{Study the variability of chemistry in a sample of cold cores: (35 species in 5 cores)}
\item{Study the isotopic fractionation at low temperature D, $^{13}C$, $^{15}N$} (cf Roueff et al. 2015)
\item{Evalutate the use of chemical codes  to determine physical parameters (density, temperature, grain temperature, extinction). Comparison with Planck data. Comparison with radiative transfer. Bayesian method of inversion}
\item{Constrain low temperature carbon chain chemistry \chem{C_xH} and \chem{C_xH_2}
\end{itemize}
