Proposed spectral coverage. The synthetic spectrum used to compute the expected SNR is shown in red. The expected rms is shown in black lines (solid: 1$\sigma$, dashed: 3$\sigma$, dotted: 5$\sigma$). Middle panne, same as above zoomed in on the y axis showing the faint lines. The bottom pannel shows the observing strategy using 18 LO tunings.
